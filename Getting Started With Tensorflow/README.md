*Welcome to the first Tensorflow tutorial!* This tutorial (amd Tensorflow in general) is best suited for people who already have a decent grasp on how machine learning works.
If you are looking to learn a more basic approach to machine learning, check out the SciKit Learn tutorials.

In this demonstration, I will go through a slight variation of Tensorflow's MNIST image recognition code exmaple line by line. The objective is to help you start to get an idea of how Tensorflow is used and to have you understand a basic implementation of a neural net in Tensorflow.
