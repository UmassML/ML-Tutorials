*Welcome to the first Tensorflow tutorial!* This tutorial (and Tensorflow in general) is best suited for people who already have a decent grasp on how machine learning works. Check out https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners for the line by line tutorial.

If you are looking to learn a more beginner-friendly approach to machine learning, check out the SciKit-Learn tutorials. If you  want to learn more about Tensorflow I would recommend checking out https://learningtensorflow.com/
