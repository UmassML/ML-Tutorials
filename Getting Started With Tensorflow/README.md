*Welcome to the first Tensorflow tutorial!* This tutorial (amd Tensorflow in general) is best suited for people who already have a decent grasp on how machine learning works. Check out https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners for a line by line tutorial.

If you are looking to learn a more beginner friendly approach to machine learning, check out the SciKit-Learn tutorials. If you have never seen any Tensorflow before and want to learn more about it I would recommend checking out https://learningtensorflow.com/
